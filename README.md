## Roadmap

Now that I am have more projects under my belt, I want to explore adding more interactive objects to my portfolio, like hover effects and image slideshows. I want to look into incorporating a different CSS library and using the GitHub API to access my repositories. I want to add functionality to the contact form and I would like to explore the idea of a feedback page, where users can offer feedback on what they see, offer advice, or propose new project ideas (either for me to work on or to work on together!).
